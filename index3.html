        <h1><b>COVID-19</b></h1>
        <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.</p>
        <p>The disease causes respiratory illnes (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.</p>
        <h2>How it Spreads</h2>
        <p>Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.</p>
